MikePath is an SVG path library developed for the surfboard modeling and part rendering system behind the <a href="http://sheldrake.net/surfboards/">cardboard surfboard project</a>.

MikePath is an SVG path tool for a CAD/CAM context. The Javascript version is used in a browser-based surfboard design system, while the Perl version is used in a part rendering system that produces CNC production files.

MikePath is a mess in places. MikePath only works with absolute coordinates. MikePath never got around to supporting quadratic Beziers. (Cubic Beziers are definitely supported - they were the starting point.) MikePath uses banner style code indenting. MikePath may be quirky.

The seed of MikePath was <a href="https://www.tinaja.com/glib/cubemath.pdf">Don Lancaster's presentation of cubic Bezier math</a>.
The SVG 1.1 spec's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/implnote.html#ArcImplementationNotes">elliptical arc implementation notes</a> were helpful. Plenty of the math Mike worked out himself, so if it's suboptimal and confusing, that's why.

MikePath is named after Mike, and he didn't expect to make it public when he named it that, and now he's embarrassed.

The successor to MikePath is MPath.
